# Tic Tac Toe

This is an awesome **_Tic Tac Toe_** game, fully optimized for _desktop_ and _mobile_.

**_Artificial Intelligence_**: To create the **_AI_** for this game I used the [Mini-Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm, which is a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory.
